# Sports betting odds
This project revolves around the practice of matched betting, which I developed an interest in and wrote a program to help automate parts of the process.


## Turnover
The program achieves a risk-free profit in turning over a high percentage of bonus bets into real cash.

Using an api to grab the best odds from various Australian bookmakers (the-odds-api.com), I calculated the highest turnover percentage achievable with the different odds across bookmakers for each upcoming game, as well as how much cash to bet on one side given a bonus bet on the other.

## Comeback
A secondary part of this project involves using the best odds to find arbitrage opportunities in the differences between bookmakers. 

Although the profit margin is very low in straight arbitrage betting, this strategy is used in conjunction with bookmaker promotions to make more consistent and significant profits with little to no risk.

The promotion explored here is for comebacks in the NBA, where if your team leads 10 but loses you get a refund on your bet as a bonus bet.
